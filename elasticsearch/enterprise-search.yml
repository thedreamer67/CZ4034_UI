## ================= Elastic Enterprise Search Configuration ==================
#
# NOTE: Elastic Enterprise Search comes with reasonable defaults.
#       Before adjusting the configuration, make sure you understand what you
#       are trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# NOTE: For passwords, the use of environment variables is encouraged
#       to keep values from being written to disk, e.g.
#       elasticsearch.password: ${ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD:changeme}
#

# ------------------------------- Elasticsearch -------------------------------

#
# -------------------------
# Per-crawl Resource Limits
# -------------------------
#
# These limits guard against infinite loops and other traps common to
# production web crawlers.
#
# If your crawler is hitting these limits, try changing your crawl rules
# or the content you're crawling. Adjust these limits as a last resort.

# crawler will stop, abandoning all remaining URLs in the crawl queue.
#
#crawler.crawl.max_duration.limit: 86400 # seconds

#
# -------------------------
# Advanced Per-crawl Limits
# -------------------------
#
# The number of parallel threads to use for each crawl.
# The main effect from increasing this value will be an increased throughput
# of the crawler at the expense of higher CPU load on Enterprise Search and
# Elasticsearch instances as well as higher load on the website being crawled.
#
#crawler.crawl.threads.limit: 10
#
# The maximum size of the crawl frontier - the list of URLs the crawler needs to visit.

# domains you access with the crawler.
#
# See https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery for

#
# If you need the Crawler to send HTTP requests through a proxy,

#
# Please note:
#  * Only HTTP and HTTPS proxies are supported at the moment.
